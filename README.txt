ICIClient - simple network client for isiCPU

Requirements:
A DirectX SDK or MSVC SDK with ddraw.lib and dxguid.lib in it.
The Winsock32 lib file
Something Microsofty to complile this stuff with

How to build it:
1. Change the paths in the project for those lib files
2. Press build in the IDE
3. Good luck


Use:
run isiCPU on a server with the -s flag
run ICIClient
select Connect from the menu and enter the IP of the server
click ok, port can be left blank.
if it worked, have fun, you can type in the main window.
if not, oh well, figure it out and if it looks like a bug tell me about it.
